# MATLAB-discord-bot
A Python bot that allows members of a Discord server to query MATLAB's command line from the chat.

Requires you to have a Discord Bot Token, and the name of the Server (also called 'Guild") within a file called ".env". This information is sensitive and should not be shared with anyone. As such, this file is not included and is instead expected of the user to create it.

The current way to query the bot is to type 'compute <command for MATLAB to run>'

No support for files yet, just simple MATLAB command inputs. History nor variables are saved between queries like the normal MATLAB IDE.
